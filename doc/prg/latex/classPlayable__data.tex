\subsection{Detailed Description}
Useful information added to playable coordinates. \doxyref{Playable\_\-data}{p.}{classPlayable__data} class provides additional information about a possible point to play -\/ especially playing priorities which are used to sort moves in order to get maximum alfa-\/beta pruning efficiency. Distinguishing playing priorities for attacker and defender provides algorithm with possibility to effectivily sort proposed moves according to their priorities ( for whom is to move )
