TGA is a GPL licensed solver of life and death problems in the game of go. It is based mainly on brute force search combined with
transposition tables, heuristics and eye analyzis. It's strength in solving mostly closed problems is about 1d. Program was a part of the
bachelor's project I submitted at Faculthy of Mathematics and Physiscs at the Charles university at Prague. More information about whole 
project and program itself are included in the doc directory.
